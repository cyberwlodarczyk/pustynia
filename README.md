## Introduction

This project is a very simple chat service with minimalistic end-to-end encryption. The server's job is to manage the rooms and broadcast all of the encrypted noise to the appropriate clients. To join a room, a random 9 letter code such as `efz-fzg-tym` and a password are required. Users can see other messages and type a new one with a label like `bob> `.

## Missing features

Due to lack of time this project lacks very important features, such as:

- Password validation
- Logging
- Chat history
- Permissions
- Rate limiting
