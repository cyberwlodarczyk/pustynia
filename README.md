# Pustynia 🐪

## Introduction

This is a very simple command-line chat service with minimalistic end-to-end encryption. The server's job is to manage rooms and broadcast encrypted data to appropriate clients. Joining a room requires a random 9-letter code such as `efz-fzg-tym` and a password. Users can see messages from others and send their own, which will appear with a label like `bob> `.

## Todos

- Docker configuration
- Better authentication
- Logging
